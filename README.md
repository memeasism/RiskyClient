A minecraft client with QoL and Performance in mind
<html><h1>Setup</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Download zip file</li>
    <li>Install fabric for the version you installed by using the <a target="_blank" href="https://fabricmc.net/">fabric installer</a> you can also use multimc, that is what I suggest</li>
